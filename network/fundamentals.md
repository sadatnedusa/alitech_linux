Networking types define different ranges and configurations for connecting devices, with each type varying by scope, area, and specific technology:

1. **PAN (Personal Area Network):** 
   - PANs are small, personal networks that cover a range typically within a few meters. They connect devices like smartphones, tablets, and laptops to each other or a central device, often via Bluetooth or USB.
   - Use case: Wireless headphones connecting to a phone, or a laptop connecting to a smartphone's hotspot.

2. **LAN (Local Area Network):**
   - LANs cover small areas, such as a single building or a campus, and are used in homes, offices, and schools to connect computers, printers, and other devices through Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
   - LANs are typically fast, with low latency, and often use Ethernet cables for connections.
   - Use case: Office network with shared resources like printers and internet access.

3. **WLAN (Wireless Local Area Network):**
   - WLANs are similar to LANs but provide wireless connectivity. Using Wi-Fi, WLANs enable devices to connect without physical cables, making them convenient for mobility within a space.
   - Use case: Home Wi-Fi network enabling mobile devices to access the internet without cables.

4. **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):**
   - MANs cover larger geographic areas than LANs, often encompassing an entire city or metropolitan area. They connect multiple LANs, allowing for interconnectivity across city-level infrastructure, typically owned by an ISP or a city authority.
   - Use case: Public Wi-Fi in a city or connecting government offices across a city.

5. **WAN (Wide Area Network):**
   - WANs span large geographic areas, often across countries or continents. The internet itself is the most prominent example of a WAN, connecting numerous LANs and other networks worldwide.
   - Use case: Corporate network connecting offices across different countries.

# What is PCAP, PCAPNG and VQA network packages

## PCAP, PCAPNG, and VQA refer to file formats or standards used to capture, analyze, or monitor network traffic. Here’s a breakdown of each:

### 1. **PCAP (Packet Capture)**
   - **Definition**: PCAP is a standard format for capturing network traffic. It allows the recording of packets sent and received over a network. It captures raw network traffic and is commonly used by network monitoring tools like Wireshark, tcpdump, and others.
   - **Usage**: It is extensively used for network troubleshooting, performance analysis, and cybersecurity forensics.
   - **Structure**: PCAP files store packet data, including headers and payloads, in a sequential manner. It records Ethernet frames, IP packets, and other layer 2 to layer 7 data.
   - **Limitation**: The original PCAP format lacks certain advanced features such as support for multiple interfaces or different time formats.

### 2. **PCAPNG (PCAP Next Generation)**
   - **Definition**: PCAPNG is an extension and improvement over the traditional PCAP format. It provides more features and flexibility, addressing the limitations of PCAP.
   - **Advantages**:
     - **Multiple interfaces**: PCAPNG supports capturing traffic from multiple interfaces at once.
     - **Meta-information**: It can store more metadata, such as the name of the capturing device, system info, and comments.
     - **Improved timestamps**: More precise timestamps are supported.
     - **File compression**: PCAPNG supports different compression methods, which helps in saving storage space.
     - **Extended block types**: It provides more sophisticated data storage structures, allowing for better packet analysis.
   - **Usage**: Preferred for more complex network analysis scenarios where capturing data from different sources or enhanced metadata is essential.

### 3. **VQA (Virtual Quality Assurance) Network Packages**
   - **Definition**: VQA is a term primarily related to Virtual Quality Assurance tools and techniques. In networking, VQA might refer to packages or methods used for analyzing or monitoring the quality of a virtualized network environment.
   - **Usage**: These could be used in scenarios where network performance in virtual machines or virtual network infrastructures needs to be monitored, such as in cloud services, data centers, or virtualized environments.
   - **Tools**: Depending on the specific context, VQA can involve tools that measure latency, jitter, packet loss, and overall network performance in virtualized infrastructures.
   - **Network Packages**: These refer to monitoring software or methods that ensure the quality of virtualized network deployments, possibly involving packet capture and analysis similar to PCAP/PCAPNG but tailored to virtualized network performance.

In summary:
- **PCAP** is a basic file format for packet capture.
- **PCAPNG** is a more advanced format with enhanced features.
- **VQA** refers to monitoring tools/packages for network quality assurance in virtual environments.

# Example of finding duplicate IP by using tcpdump, wireshark

##  You can use Wireshark to identify duplicate ip from pcap file	

```bash
sudo apt install tshark
tshark -r bond0nic5downup.pcap -V
tshark -r bond0nic5downup.pcap -V| grep -i "duplicate"
```

OR 
 	
- You can use tshark (cli) to identify duplicate ip from pcap file	

Install tcpdump and tshark on linux machine

```
Truncated
[Duplicate IP address detected for 172.25.60.82 (90:e2:ba:d3:f1:88) - also in use by 02:42:ac:19:3c:52 (frame 916)]
[Expert Info (Warning/Sequence): Duplicate IP address configured (172.25.60.82)]
 	            [Duplicate IP address configured (172.25.60.82)]
	            [This is a TCP duplicate ack]
	        [Duplicate ACK #: 3]
	        [Duplicate to the ACK in frame: 630]
	            [Expert Info (Note/Sequence): Duplicate ACK (#3)]
	                [Duplicate ACK (#3)]
```

	You can use wireshark which is a gui app or you can use tshark which is it's cli counterpart.
	Besides, you can visualize the pcap using several visualization tools:
	        • tnv - The Network Visualizer or Time-based Network Visualizer
	        • afterglow - A collection of scripts which facilitate the process of generating graphs
	        • INAV - Interactive Network Active-traffic Visualization
	If you want to analyze the pcap file you can use the excelent nsm-console.
	Last, but not least, you can upload your pcap to pcapr.net and watch it there. pcapr.net is a kind of social website to analyze and comment to traffic captures.


## How to create pcap file	

```bash
tcpdump -i nic5 -w /tmp/nic5.pcap
tcpdump -i nic6 -w /tmp/nic6.pcap
```

# Wireshark  filters

| **Wireshark Filter** | **Description** |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| `tcp.analysis.flags`  | Shows TCP issues that Wireshark has flagged (e.g., retransmissions, duplicate ACKs, out-of-order packets). |
| `ip.src == 172.21.60.33` | Filters the traffic where the source IP address is `172.21.60.33`. This can be used to isolate traffic coming from a specific IP. |
| `!(arp or dns or icmp)` | Excludes ARP, DNS, and ICMP traffic from the results. This helps clean up the capture by removing these protocols if they are not relevant. |
| `tcp contains facebook` | Searches for TCP packets that contain the word "facebook" in the data payload, likely for identifying Facebook-related traffic. |
| `tcp.flags.syn == 1` | Filters for TCP SYN packets. SYN packets are used during the TCP three-way handshake to initiate a connection. |
| `tcp.flags.reset == 1` | Filters for TCP RST (reset) packets. These are sent when a connection is forcefully closed or reset. |
| `frame contains google` | Searches for any packets that contain the word "google" in the frame, useful for identifying Google-related traffic. |
| `arp.duplicate-address-detected` | Detects duplicate IP addresses on the network by identifying ARP packets indicating a duplicate IP address detection. |

These filters help narrow down specific network traffic, diagnose issues, or monitor for particular content or events within the captured data. Would you like more details on any of these filters or help applying them in Wireshark?

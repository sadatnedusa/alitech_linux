# What is env - enviornment variable

- Using the `env` shebang in your scripts helps ensure that Python 3 (or any other interpreter) is located and used dynamically based on your system's environment. 
- This approach makes your scripts more portable and adaptable to different environments. Here’s how the `env` shebang works and how it helps with learning and running Python 3 scripts.

### Shebang with `env` for Python 3

When you write a Python script, the shebang line is the first thing that is executed by the operating system to find the appropriate interpreter. If you directly specify the path to `python3` (e.g., `#!/usr/bin/python3`), it will work fine on systems where `python3` is installed in that specific location. However, on some systems, the Python executable might be located elsewhere, like `/usr/local/bin/python3` or another path.

To make your script work across different systems without worrying about where Python 3 is installed, you can use the `env` command in the shebang like this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env python3
```

### How It Works

1. **Dynamic Path Resolution**: 
   - The `/usr/bin/env` command searches for the `python3` interpreter in the directories listed in the system’s `PATH` environment variable. This means you don’t have to hardcode the interpreter's path, making your script portable.
   
2. **System Independence**: 
   - If you use `#!/usr/bin/python3`, the script will only work on systems where Python 3 is installed exactly at `/usr/bin/python3`. But with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`, the script will work on systems where Python 3 is installed in any location as long as it is included in the `PATH`.

3. **Switching Between Python Versions**: 
   - If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, using `env` allows you to specify that Python 3 should be used, ensuring compatibility with your script.

### Example: Python 3 Script with `env`

Here’s a simple Python script that uses the `env` shebang to run with Python 3:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

print("Learning Python 3 with env shebang!")
```

To run this script:

1. **Save the script**: Save the above code in a file, for example, `script.py`.
2. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x script.py
   ```
3. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   ./script.py
   ```

### Learning Benefits

- **Portability**: By using `#!/usr/bin/env python3`, you don’t need to worry about the exact installation path of Python 3. This makes learning easier, as you can focus on Python concepts without needing to configure your system every time.
  
- **Consistency**: When learning Python, it’s common to switch between different environments (local machine, virtual environments, cloud servers, etc.). The `env` shebang ensures that your script will consistently use the correct Python version in these different setups.

- **Ease of Use**: For beginners, using `env` is one less thing to worry about because it abstracts away the specifics of where the Python interpreter is located. This allows you to focus on learning Python 3 itself rather than setting up your environment.

### Conclusion

The `env` shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`) helps you run Python 3 scripts in a system-independent way, making it easier to learn Python without worrying about interpreter paths. It ensures your script works on any system with Python 3 installed, promoting portability and flexibility.

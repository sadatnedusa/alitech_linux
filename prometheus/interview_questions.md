    - How can you configure it?

16. **How does Prometheus handle high cardinality data?**
    - What are the potential issues with high cardinality?

17. **How can you monitor Prometheus itself?**

18. **How does Prometheus handle data retention?**
    - Explain the purpose of flags like `--storage.tsdb.retention.time`.

19. **What is federation in Prometheus?**
    - How does it help in scaling Prometheus?

23. **What are WAL (Write-Ahead Logs) in Prometheus?**
    - How does WAL improve data reliability?

24. **How would you optimize Prometheus for better performance?**
    - Discuss strategies for optimizing resource utilization.

25. **How does Prometheus handle high-availability?**
    - What is the concept of remote write and remote read in Prometheus?

26. **How do you implement multi-tenant monitoring with Prometheus?**
    - Can Prometheus support multiple tenants or clusters?

27. **What is Thanos?**
    - How does Thanos extend Prometheus' capabilities?

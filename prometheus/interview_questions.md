# **Prometheus interview questions** from beginner to advanced levels:

### **Beginner Level:**

1. **What is Prometheus?**
   - **Answer:** Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. It collects and stores its metrics as time series data, i.e., metrics information is stored with the timestamp at which it was recorded, alongside optional key-value pairs called labels.

2. **What are the key features of Prometheus?**
   - **Answer:**
     - A multi-dimensional data model based on key-value pairs
     - PromQL for querying metrics
     - Pull-based metrics collection
     - Time-series database (TSDB) built-in
     - Service discovery
     - Built-in alerting and integration with Alertmanager
     - Designed for reliability and scalability

3. **How does Prometheus collect metrics?**
   - **Answer:** Prometheus uses a pull-based model where it scrapes metrics from targets (like application endpoints, exporters) at specified intervals.

4. **What are exporters in Prometheus?**
   - **Answer:** Exporters are components that produce metrics in a format Prometheus understands. For example, node_exporter exposes hardware and OS metrics from Linux systems.

5. **Explain the Prometheus data model.**
   - **Answer:** The data model is a **multi-dimensional time-series** where:
     - A metric name identifies the time series
     - Labels (key-value pairs) allow for dimensionality, e.g., identifying the environment or a particular instance

6. **What are Prometheus labels?**
   - **Answer:** Labels are key-value pairs that are attached to a time series and allow for grouping and filtering metrics (e.g., environment=prod or job=nginx).

7. **What is an instance and a job in Prometheus?**
   - **Answer:** 
     - **Instance:** A single endpoint that is scraped (e.g., a single server or application).
     - **Job:** A group of instances performing the same function (e.g., all instances of your nginx servers).

8. **What are the different types of metrics in Prometheus?**
   - **Answer:**
     - **Counter:** A metric that only increases over time (e.g., HTTP requests).
     - **Gauge:** A metric that can increase or decrease (e.g., memory usage).
     - **Histogram:** Samples observations and counts them in configurable buckets (e.g., request duration).
     - **Summary:** Similar to a histogram but provides percentiles (e.g., 95th percentile latency).

9. **How do you define and configure a target in Prometheus?**
   - **Answer:** Targets are defined in the `prometheus.yml` file under the `scrape_configs` section. You specify the job name and the targets (usually endpoint URLs) for Prometheus to scrape.

10. **What is the role of the `prometheus.yml` file?**
    - **Answer:** The `prometheus.yml` file is the main configuration file where scrape targets, alerting rules, service discovery configurations, and more are defined.

11. **How does Prometheus handle service discovery?**
    - **Answer:** Prometheus can discover targets dynamically through service discovery mechanisms like Kubernetes, Consul, DNS, EC2, and others. This allows automatic updates to targets as infrastructure changes.

### **Intermediate Level:**

12. **How do you create custom metrics in Prometheus?**
    - **Answer:** You can instrument your application code using Prometheus client libraries (e.g., Go, Python, Java, etc.) to expose custom metrics. For example, you could add a counter for the number of times a user logs in.

13. **What is PromQL?**
    - **Answer:** PromQL (Prometheus Query Language) is the query language used to retrieve and aggregate time-series data. It allows for complex queries on metrics, such as filtering by labels and computing rates, averages, or sums.

14. **Explain the different aggregation functions in PromQL.**
    - **Answer:** Common aggregation functions include:
      - `sum()`: Sums up values across a time series.
      - `avg()`: Computes the average of values.
      - `max()`, `min()`: Maximum and minimum values.
      - `rate()`: Computes the per-second average rate of increase for counters.

15. **How do you set up alerts in Prometheus?**
    - **Answer:** Alerts are defined in the `alert_rules.yml` file, specifying the conditions under which alerts are triggered using PromQL expressions. These alerts are sent to Alertmanager for processing and routing.

16. **What is a scrape interval in Prometheus?**
    - **Answer:** The scrape interval is the frequency at which Prometheus pulls metrics from a target. It is defined in the `prometheus.yml` configuration under `scrape_configs`.

17. **How does Prometheus handle high cardinality data?**
    - **Answer:** High cardinality (e.g., too many unique label combinations) can strain Prometheus' storage and query performance. To mitigate this, carefully select labels and reduce unnecessary label usage.

18. **How can you monitor Prometheus itself?**
    - **Answer:** Prometheus provides built-in metrics about itself, which can be scraped by another Prometheus instance or viewed in Grafana. Metrics like scrape times, memory usage, and storage size are available.

19. **How does Prometheus handle data retention?**
    - **Answer:** Prometheus uses the `--storage.tsdb.retention.time` flag to determine how long data is stored. The default is 15 days, but it can be adjusted as needed.

20. **What is federation in Prometheus?**
    - **Answer:** Federation allows a Prometheus server to scrape metrics from another Prometheus server. This is useful for aggregating metrics from multiple Prometheus instances, particularly in large environments.

21. **Explain how Prometheus can integrate with Grafana for visualization.**
    - **Answer:** Grafana is often used to visualize Prometheus data. You can configure Prometheus as a data source in Grafana and create dashboards based on PromQL queries.

22. **How do you handle large-scale environments with Prometheus?**
    - **Answer:** In large environments, you can use Prometheus federation, sharding, or external storage solutions (like Thanos or Cortex) to scale out.

### **Advanced Level:**

23. **How does Prometheus store data?**
    - **Answer:** Prometheus uses a custom time-series database (TSDB). It stores data in memory and writes it to disk as "blocks," typically 2 hours long. Each block contains a set of time series, chunks, and an index.

24. **What are WAL (Write-Ahead Logs) in Prometheus?**
    - **Answer:** The WAL (Write-Ahead Log) is used to ensure reliability. When Prometheus ingests data, it first writes it to the WAL before it is persisted in a TSDB block, ensuring that no data is lost in case of a crash.

25. **How would you optimize Prometheus for better performance?**
    - **Answer:** Optimization strategies include:
      - Reducing the number of active time series.
      - Increasing the scrape interval to reduce load.
      - Using sharding to distribute data collection across multiple Prometheus instances.
      - Offloading old data to remote storage.

26. **How does Prometheus handle high-availability?**
    - **Answer:** Prometheus itself does not natively support high availability, but multiple instances can be run in parallel with identical configurations. Thanos or Cortex can be used to extend Prometheus for HA and long-term storage.

27. **What is Thanos?**
    - **Answer:** Thanos extends Prometheus by providing long-term storage, global querying across multiple Prometheus instances, high availability, and downsampling of old data.

28. **How would you migrate from one Prometheus instance to another without losing metrics?**
    - **Answer:** Migration can be done using the remote write/read feature, transferring metrics to a remote storage system, or by federating data between the old and new Prometheus instances during the transition.

29. **What are the common bottlenecks in a Prometheus setup?**
    - **Answer:** Common bottlenecks include:
      - Too many active time series.
      - High cardinality of labels.
      - Large scrape intervals.
      - Overloaded disk I/O due to frequent WAL flushes.

30. **What are remote storage integrations with Prometheus?**
    - **Answer:** Remote storage allows Prometheus to send (remote write) and query (remote read) data to/from external long-term storage systems like Thanos, Cortex, InfluxDB, or other databases.

31. **How does Prometheus interact with Kubernetes?**
    - **Answer:** Prometheus can automatically discover Kubernetes services and pods using Kubernetes service discovery. It scrapes metrics exposed by applications running in Kubernetes using the Kubernetes API.

32. **Explain how you would secure Prometheus.**
    - **Answer:** Security for Prometheus includes:
      - Enabling HTTPS for secure communication.
      - Setting up authentication for access control.
      - Limiting access to the Prometheus web UI and API.
      - Using a reverse proxy like Nginx for more advanced authentication and security features.

These answers provide a detailed understanding of Prometheus and should help you prepare for interviews at various levels.

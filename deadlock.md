### Necessary Conditions for a Deadlock

In computing, particularly in the context of **operating systems** and **concurrent programming**, a **deadlock** occurs when a set of processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for another to release a resource.
For a deadlock to happen, there are certain **necessary conditions** that must all be true at the same time. These conditions were first described by **Coffman et al.** in 1971.

### The Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock

A **deadlock** will occur if all of the following four conditions hold simultaneously:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**
2. **Hold and Wait**
3. **No Preemption**
4. **Circular Wait**

### Detailed Explanation of Each Condition:

#### 1. **Mutual Exclusion**
   - **Definition**: At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode, i.e., only one process can use the resource at any given time. If a second process requests the resource, it must wait until the first process releases it.
   - **Example**: A printer is a resource that can only be used by one process at a time. If another process requests the printer, it must wait.

#### 2. **Hold and Wait**
   - **Definition**: A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other processes.
   - **Example**: Process A holds the printer and needs the scanner. Meanwhile, Process B holds the scanner and needs the printer. Both processes are blocked and waiting for each other to release the resources.
   
#### 3. **No Preemption**
   - **Definition**: Resources cannot be forcibly removed from the processes holding them. Once a process acquires a resource, it must release it voluntarily. No process can be preempted to free up resources.
   - **Example**: If Process A holds a resource and requires another resource that is held by Process B, the system cannot forcibly take the resource away from Process A. Process A must release the resource voluntarily.

#### 4. **Circular Wait**
   - **Definition**: A set of processes {P1, P2, ..., Pn} exists such that each process Pi is waiting for a resource that is held by process Pi+1, with the last process Pn waiting for a resource held by P1, forming a circular chain of dependencies.
   - **Example**: Process A is waiting for Process B’s resource, Process B is waiting for Process C’s resource, and Process C is waiting for Process A’s resource. This forms a cycle and no process can proceed.

### Which Condition is NOT Necessary for Deadlock?

#### **Preemption** is NOT a necessary condition for a deadlock to occur.

- **Preemption**: This refers to forcibly taking a resource from a process that holds it. In the context of deadlocks, preemption is not required for a deadlock to happen. A deadlock can occur even without preemption if the other three conditions are met: mutual exclusion, hold and wait, and circular wait.
  
  - **Why is Preemption Not Necessary?** 
    - If a system does not allow preemption (i.e., resources are only released voluntarily), a deadlock can still occur because the processes can still end up in a circular wait. For example, Process A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2, while Process B holds Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1, creating a circular wait and a deadlock. Preemption isn't required for this to happen.
    
#### Conclusion:
- **Preemption** is the correct answer as the condition **not necessary** for a deadlock.
- The four necessary conditions for a deadlock are:
  1. **Mutual Exclusion**
  2. **Hold and Wait**
  3. **No Preemption**
  4. **Circular Wait**

# systemctl_list-units_--all

The `systemctl list-units --all` command in Linux is used to list all the units that are loaded by `systemd`, including active, inactive, and failed units. Units represent resources that systemd knows about, such as services, sockets, devices, and mounts. Here's what each part of the command does:

- **`systemctl`**: The main command to interact with the `systemd` system and service manager.
- **`list-units`**: This subcommand lists all currently loaded units in `systemd`.
- **`--all`**: This option includes not only active units but also inactive or failed ones in the output.

The output will typically include the following columns:
- **UNIT**: The name of the unit.
- **LOAD**: Whether the unit's configuration has been properly loaded.
- **ACTIVE**: The high-level unit activation state (e.g., active, inactive, failed).
- **SUB**: The low-level unit activation state.
- **DESCRIPTION**: A brief description of the unit.

You can also filter by specific types of units, like services, using:
```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --all
```

- It lists the services and shows how much time each took to start up. 
- This can be useful for identifying any services that are taking longer than expected to start, potentially impacting system boot times.

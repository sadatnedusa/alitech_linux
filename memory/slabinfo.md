# slabinfo powerful utility

- The `slabinfo` tool is a powerful utility that provides detailed information about kernel slab cache usage in Linux. 
- Slab caches are used to manage frequently allocated and deallocated objects efficiently. 
- By understanding how slab caches are utilized, you can identify potential memory-related issues like fragmentation, memory wastage, or inefficiencies.

Here's how to learn and use `slabinfo` for troubleshooting purposes:

### 1. **Understanding the Slab Allocator:**
   The Linux kernel uses a slab allocator to manage memory for frequently used kernel objects. The slab allocator divides memory into small chunks called **slabs**, each of which can hold multiple objects of a fixed size. This reduces memory fragmentation and improves performance for common kernel operations.

   Slab caches are used to store these slabs, and each cache is dedicated to a specific type of kernel object (e.g., inodes, dentry structures, file handles).

### 2. **Using `slabinfo`:**
   The `slabinfo` tool allows you to inspect the details of each slab cache in the kernel. It provides information about the usage of these caches, including the number of active objects, total memory usage, and how efficiently the slabs are being used.

   To use `slabinfo`, run the following command:
   ```bash
   slabinfo
   ```

   The output will look something like this:
   ```
   slabinfo - version: 2.1
   # name             <active_objs> <num_objs> <objsize> <objperslab> <pagesperslab>
   kmalloc-8               128  128    8    128     1
   kmalloc-16              512  512   16     64     1
   kmalloc-32              64   64    32     32     1
   kmalloc-64              256  256   64     16     1
   ...
   ```

### 3. **Interpreting `slabinfo` Output:**

Each line of the output describes a slab cache and provides key information:

| Field           | Description                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **name**        | The name of the slab cache (e.g., `kmalloc-64`, `dentry`, `inode`). |
| **active_objs** | Number of currently allocated (active) objects in the cache.   |
| **num_objs**    | Total number of objects in the cache, both allocated and free. |
| **objsize**     | The size of each object in bytes.                              |
| **objperslab**  | Number of objects per slab (each slab can hold multiple objects). |
| **pagesperslab**| Number of pages per slab (how many pages make up one slab).    |

### 4. **Practical Use Cases for Troubleshooting:**

#### 4.1. **Detecting Memory Wastage:**
   By comparing the **active_objs** and **num_objs** columns, you can identify if there are many unused objects sitting in the slab cache. A large difference between these numbers might indicate memory wastage, especially if those objects are not being freed or reused efficiently.

   For example, if you see something like this:
   ```
   kmalloc-64    10000    50000   64   16   1
   ```
   It means that only 10,000 out of 50,000 allocated objects are in use. This could indicate over-allocation of resources.

#### 4.2. **Tracking Slab Fragmentation:**
   Slab fragmentation occurs when slabs are only partially filled but still consume entire pages of memory. You can detect this by looking at how many objects are allocated per slab (**objperslab**) and how many pages are used per slab (**pagesperslab**). If slabs contain many unused objects, it can lead to memory fragmentation.

   - Low **objperslab** values, combined with large **pagesperslab** values, might indicate wasted memory.

#### 4.3. **Identifying Inefficient Caches:**
   Some slab caches may be over-allocated or under-utilized, consuming excessive memory. Check if caches like `kmalloc` have a high number of unused objects, as that could be a sign of inefficiency in memory usage.

#### 4.4. **Monitoring Kernel Object Usage:**
   The slab caches for frequently used kernel objects like inodes, dentries, and file handles (`dentry`, `inode_cache`, etc.) provide insight into how system resources are being consumed. For instance, if you are troubleshooting performance issues related to filesystem access, you can monitor these caches to understand their current usage.

   Example:
   ```bash
   slabinfo -n dentry
   ```

   This will show detailed information about the `dentry` cache, which holds directory entry objects. A high number of active objects relative to total objects might indicate the system is under memory pressure related to directory lookups or file access.

### 5. **Advanced Options:**

`slabinfo` provides several useful command-line options for advanced usage:

#### 5.1. **Display Statistics for Specific Slabs:**
   You can display detailed statistics for a specific slab cache:
   ```bash
   slabinfo -s <cache_name>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   slabinfo -s kmalloc-128
   ```

   This will give you a detailed view of memory usage and object allocation for the `kmalloc-128` cache, which is used for allocating 128-byte memory objects.

#### 5.2. **Display Usage in Kilobytes:**
   To get a human-readable display of the slab memory usage (in KB), use the `-k` option:
   ```bash
   slabinfo -k
   ```

   This can give you a clearer view of how much memory each slab cache is using.

#### 5.3. **Sort Slabs by Usage:**
   If you want to find the slabs that are consuming the most memory, you can sort the output by the number of objects or memory used. For example, to sort by the number of allocated objects:
   ```bash
   slabinfo -S <sort_field>
   ```

   Example:
   ```bash
   slabinfo -S num_objs
   ```

   This will sort the output by the total number of objects in the slab caches, helping you quickly identify which caches are consuming the most memory.

#### 5.4. **Compact Slab Information:**
   To display compact information for all slabs, use the `-a` option:
   ```bash
   slabinfo -a
   ```

   This shows slab activity across the entire system, including active objects, total objects, and object sizes, in a summarized format.

### 6. **Real-Time Monitoring with `slabtop`:**
   
   For real-time slab cache monitoring, use the `slabtop` command. It's like a top command for slab memory usage:
   ```bash
   slabtop
   ```
   This provides a continuously updating view of slab usage, sorted by memory consumption. The fields are similar to `slabinfo`, but the display updates in real-time, making it useful for diagnosing issues on a live system.

   Example output from `slabtop`:
   ```
   Active / Total Objects (% used)    : 45200 / 100000 (45%)
   Active / Total Slabs (% used)      : 4500 / 5000 (90%)
   Active / Total Caches (% used)     : 90 / 100 (90%)
   Active / Total Size (% used)       :  44.2M / 100M (45%)
   ```  

### 7. **Practical Use Case for Slab Cache Management:**
   
#### 7.1. **Monitoring Excessive Cache Growth:**
   Suppose you're troubleshooting a performance issue and suspect that excessive memory is being used by slab caches (for instance, due to inode or dentry buildup). You can monitor these caches with `slabinfo` or `slabtop` and look for rapid growth in caches such as `dentry`, `inode_cache`, or `kmalloc`.

#### 7.2. **Slab Cache Pressure and Memory Leaks:**
   If a cache is growing excessively without shrinking (even when its objects are no longer needed), it could indicate a memory leak. In this case, you can use `slabinfo` to monitor the active and total object count over time. If the active count stays high or keeps increasing, you likely have a leak or inefficient cache cleanup.

### 8. **Example Workflow for Troubleshooting:**

1. **Run `slabinfo`:**
   ```bash
   slabinfo
   ```
   Inspect the output for any slab caches that seem unusually large or have a high number of inactive objects.

2. **Focus on Specific Slab Caches:**
   If you notice a specific slab cache is unusually large, you can get more detailed information:
   ```bash
   slabinfo -s dentry
   ```

3. **Use `slabtop` for Real-Time Monitoring:**
   Run `slabtop` to monitor the slab usage in real-time, especially if the issue is happening under specific system loads or over time.

4. **Analyze the Cache Growth Pattern:**
   Look for caches where the number of inactive objects (unused but still allocated) is growing, indicating potential memory wastage or a memory leak.

5. **Optimize or Restart Services:**
   If you find a service or kernel module that is holding onto excessive slab cache memory, consider optimizing it, tuning cache parameters, or restarting the service to release the memory.

### 9. **Summary:**
   - **Memory Diagnostics**: Use slabinfo to inspect slab cache memory usage and look for inefficiencies or excessive growth.
Fragmentation Insight: Analyze how objects are distributed within slabs and how that might contribute to fragmentation.
Performance Troubleshooting: Look for caches that are using excessive memory, causing system slowdown or pressure on available memory.
By mastering the slabinfo tool, you can diagnose memory fragmentation and slab-related issues more effectively.

# **Concurrency, parallelism**

Concurrency, parallelism, and threads are related but distinct concepts, especially in the context of computing and programming. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

### 1. **Concurrency**:
   **Definition**: Concurrency is when multiple tasks or operations appear to be running simultaneously but might not necessarily be executing at the same time. It allows multiple tasks to make progress by managing time-sharing or interleaving between them.

   - **Key Characteristics**:
     - Tasks are logically progressing at the same time but not necessarily executing simultaneously.
     - The system switches between tasks, giving the **illusion** that they are running together.
     - **Time-sharing** is used, where multiple tasks take turns in small time slices.
     - Often implemented in a **single-core system** where the processor quickly switches between tasks (context switching).

   - **Example**:
     - A web server handling multiple client requests by switching between them, handling part of one request, then switching to another.

   - **Real-world Analogy**:
     - A person writing an email, then answering a phone call, and then going back to the email. They're working on both tasks but not doing them at the same exact moment.

   - **Key Concept**:
     - **Task switching** happens in concurrency. It doesn’t mean multiple tasks are necessarily running simultaneously; rather, they're making progress together.

### 2. **Parallelism**:
   **Definition**: Parallelism is when multiple tasks or operations are executed **at the same time** on different processors or cores. In parallelism, tasks are broken down and processed simultaneously to speed up execution.

   - **Key Characteristics**:
     - Tasks are actually running at the same time, utilizing multiple cores/processors.
     - **Simultaneous execution** of tasks.
     - Often implemented in **multi-core** or **multi-processor systems**.
     - It leads to faster execution when tasks are truly independent and can be divided into sub-tasks.

   - **Example**:
     - Running multiple computations like matrix multiplication or sorting on different processors at the same time to get faster results.

   - **Real-world Analogy**:
     - Multiple people working on different sections of a project simultaneously to finish it faster.

   - **Key Concept**:
     - In parallelism, multiple tasks **truly** execute simultaneously, leveraging hardware with multiple cores.

### 3. **Thread**:
   **Definition**: A thread is a unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads can run concurrently within the same process, sharing resources such as memory, while executing independently.

   - **Key Characteristics**:
     - A thread is like a **lightweight process**.
     - **Shared memory space** between threads in the same process.
     - Each thread runs independently, but they share code, data, and resources.
     - Threads can run **concurrently** (via time-sharing) or in **parallel** (on multiple cores).

   - **Example**:
     - A web browser may have separate threads for rendering the page, handling user input, and fetching data from the network simultaneously.

   - **Real-world Analogy**:
     - Think of a process as a business with different departments (threads). While they all work on different things (tasks), they share the same resources (office space, utilities, etc.).

   - **Key Concept**:
     - Threads are a mechanism to enable concurrency and parallelism within the same process, often for improving performance.

### **Key Differences**:

| Aspect                    | **Concurrency**                                  | **Parallelism**                                 | **Threads**                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**              | Multiple tasks progress simultaneously, though not necessarily at the same time. | Tasks are executed at the same time on multiple processors. | Unit of execution within a process; can be used for both concurrency and parallelism. |
| **Hardware Requirements**  | Can work on a single-core system using time-sharing. | Requires multiple cores or processors to execute tasks in parallel. | Threads can run on a single core (concurrently) or across multiple cores (in parallel). |
| **Relation to Tasks**      | Tasks take turns to progress. | Tasks are divided and executed simultaneously.  | Multiple threads can be created in a single process to perform different tasks.        |
| **Realization**            | Achieved through task switching and scheduling. | Achieved by dividing tasks across processors. | Threads are lightweight sub-tasks within a process. |
| **Programming Difficulty** | Easier but still requires careful synchronization and task management. | Requires tasks that can be divided and executed independently. | Thread synchronization and communication (shared memory) can introduce complexity. |
| **Example**                | Handling multiple I/O operations by switching between them. | Performing matrix multiplication using multiple CPU cores. | A web server creating threads to handle different requests.  |

### **Concurrency vs. Parallelism Summary**:
- **Concurrency** is about managing multiple tasks so they make progress together (can be sequential or overlapping). It doesn’t mean they are running at the exact same time.
- **Parallelism** is about running tasks **simultaneously**, leveraging multiple processors to complete tasks faster.

Threads can implement both **concurrency** and **parallelism** depending on how the operating system and hardware handle them.
